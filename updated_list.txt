Stress and Anxiety Management in Nursing Students: Biofeedback and Mindfulness
Meditation.

Ratanasiripong P, Park JF, Ratanasiripong N, Kathalae D.

BACKGROUND: The current study investigated the efficacy of two brief intervention
programs-biofeedback and mindfulness meditation-on levels of state anxiety and
perceived stress in second-year Thai nursing students as they began clinical
training.
METHOD: Eighty-nine participants from a public nursing college in Thailand were
randomly assigned to one of three groups: biofeedback group, mindfulness
meditation group, or a control group. All participants were given pre- and
postintervention surveys, which included demographic information; the State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory (State Anxiety Scale); and the Perceived Stress Scale.
RESULTS: Findings indicated that biofeedback significantly reduced anxiety and
maintained stress levels in nursing students. Mindfulness meditation similarly
decreased anxiety levels, while also significantly lowering stress levels. The
biofeedback group exhibited significant reduction in anxiety levels among the
three groups at postintervention.
CONCLUSION: Despite stressors and demands nursing students experience as they
begin clinical practice, study findings support the use of biofeedback and
mindfulness meditation interventions to assist nursing students in managing
stress and anxiety.

BACKGROUND: Nursing students often experience depression, anxiety, stress and
decreased mindfulness which may decrease their patient care effectiveness.
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) effectively reduced depression, anxiety
and stress, and increased mindfulness in previous research with other
populations, but there is sparse evidence regarding its effectiveness for nursing
students in Korea.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of MBSR on depression, anxiety, stress and
mindfulness in Korean nursing students.
DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Fifty (50) nursing students at KN University College of
Nursing in South Korea were randomly assigned to two groups. Data from 44
students, MBSR (n=21) and a wait list (WL) control (n=23) were analyzed.
METHODS: The MBSR group practiced mindfulness meditation for 2 h every week for 8
weeks. The WL group did not receive MBSR intervention. Standardized
self-administered questionnaires of depression, anxiety, stress and mindfulness
were administered at the baseline prior to the MBSR program and at completion (at
8 weeks).
RESULTS: Compared with WL participants, MBSR participants reported significantly 
greater decreases in depression, anxiety and stress, and greater increase in
mindfulness.
CONCLUSION: A program of MBSR was effective when it was used with nursing
students in reducing measures of depression, anxiety and stress, and increasing
their mindful awareness. MBSR shows promise for use with nursing students to
address their experience of mild depression, anxiety and stress, and to increase 
mindfulness in academic and clinical work, warranting further study.

Mindfulness-based interventions have proven effective for the transdiagnostic
treatment of heterogeneous anxiety disorders. So far, no study has investigated
the potential of mindfulness-based treatments when delivered remotely via the
Internet. The current trial aims at evaluating the efficacy of a stand-alone,
unguided, Internet-based mindfulness treatment program for anxiety. Ninety-one
participants diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety
disorder, panic disorder, or anxiety disorder not otherwise specified were
randomly assigned to a mindfulness treatment group (MTG) or to an online
discussion forum control group (CG). Mindfulness treatment consisted of 96 audio 
files with instructions for various mindfulness meditation exercises. Primary and
secondary outcome measures were assessed at pre-, posttreatment, and at 6-months 
follow-up. Participants of the MTG showed a larger decrease of symptoms of
anxiety, depression, and insomnia from pre- to postassessment than participants
of the CG (Cohen's d(between)=0.36-0.99). Within effect sizes were large in the
MTG (d=0.82-1.58) and small to moderate in the CG (d=0.45-0.76). In contrast to
participants of the CG, participants of the MTG also achieved a moderate
improvement in their quality of life. The study provided encouraging results for 
an Internet-based mindfulness protocol in the treatment of primary anxiety
disorders. Future replications of these results will show whether Web-based
mindfulness meditation can constitute a valid alternative to existing,
evidence-based cognitive-behavioural Internet treatments. The trial was
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01577290).

This randomised controlled pilot trial tested a six-week mindfulness-based
intervention in a sample of pregnant women experiencing high levels of perceived 
stress and pregnancy anxiety. Forty-seven women enrolled between 10 and 25 weeks 
gestation were randomly assigned to either a series of weekly Mindful Awareness
Practices classes (n = 24) with home practice or to a reading control condition
(n = 23). Hierarchical linear models of between-group differences in change over 
time demonstrated that participants in the mindfulness intervention experienced
larger decreases from pre-to post-intervention in pregnancy-specific anxiety and 
pregnancy-related anxiety (PRA) than participants in the reading control
condition. However, these effects were not sustained through follow-up at six
weeks post-intervention. Participants in both groups experienced increased
mindfulness, as well as decreased perceived stress and state anxiety over the
course of the intervention and follow-up periods. This study is one of the first 
randomised controlled pilot trials of a mindfulness meditation intervention
during pregnancy and provides some evidence that mindfulness training during
pregnancy may effectively reduce PRA and worry. We discuss some of the dilemmas
in pursuing this translational strategy and offer suggestions for researchers
interested in conducting mind-body interventions during pregnancy.

Mindfulness meditation techniques are increasingly popular both as a life-style
choice and therapeutic adjunct for a range of mental and physical health
conditions. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which
mindfulness meditation and its constituent practices might produce positive
change in cognition and emotion. Our study directly compared the effects of
Focused Attention (FA) and Open-Monitoring (OM) meditation on alerting, orienting
and executive attention network function in healthy individuals. Participants
were randomized to three intervention groups: open-focused meditation, focused
attention, and relaxation control. Participants completed an emotional variant of
the Attention Network Test (ANT) at baseline and post-intervention. OM and FA
practice improved executive attention, with no change observed in the relaxation 
control group. Improvements in executive attention occurred in the absence of
change in subjective/self-report mood and cognitive function. Baseline levels of 
dispositional/trait mindfulness were positively correlated with executive control
in the ANT at baseline. Our results suggest that mindfulness meditation might
usefully target deficits in executive attention that characterise mood and
anxiety disorders.

The Chinese medicine construct "stagnation" in mind-body connection mediates the 
effects of mindfulness training on depression and anxiety.

Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. hmlosw@hku.hk

OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have identified different, but highly correlated
variables explaining the effects of mindfulness training. Many of them are
limited by tautological explanation. Under the framework of the mind-body
connection, mindfulness training cultivates body awareness and promotes
self-management of illness. Stagnation, a concept from Chinese medicine, may help
explain the mechanism of change in mindfulness training.
METHODS: Individuals with depressive and anxiety symptoms (n=82) were randomized 
to either a Compassion-Mindfulness Therapy (C-MT) program or a waitlist control
condition. The effect of stagnation as a mediator was investigated for dependent 
variables including depression, anxiety, and other physical and mental health
variables.
MAJOR OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety, stagnation, physical distress, daily
functioning, positive affect, negative affect.
RESULTS: Compared with the participants in the control group, those who completed
C-MT demonstrated significant decreases in depression, F(1, 78)=15.67, p<.001,
anxiety, F(1, 78)=7.72, p<.001, stagnation, F(1, 78)=4.96, p<.001, and other
body-mind-spirit well-being measures. After entering the change in stagnation as 
the mediator, the effect of treatment reduced: depression (.35-.22), anxiety
(.33-.05), and same patterns in other three secondary measures. The Sobel test
was administered and significant reductions between group and depression (z=2.18,
p=.029), anxiety (z=2.21, p=.027), and three secondary other measures (p<.05)
were indicated.
CONCLUSION: The study provides initial support for the role of stagnation in
mediating changes in mindfulness training. It adds evidence to body-mind
nondualism and offers new possibilities in studying treatment process and change 
mechanism.

BACKGROUND: The reduction in adrenergic activity and anxiety associated with
meditation may be beneficial for patients with implantable cardioverter
defibrillators.
PURPOSE: This study aims to determine the feasibility of a phone-delivered
mindfulness intervention in patients with defibrillators and to obtain
preliminary indications of efficacy on mindfulness and anxiety.
METHODS: Clinically stable outpatients were randomized to a mindfulness
intervention (eight weekly individual phone sessions) or to a scripted follow-up 
phone call. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Five Facets
of Mindfulness to measure anxiety and mindfulness, and multivariate linear
regression to estimate the intervention effect on pre-post-intervention changes
in these variables.
RESULTS: We enrolled 45 patients (23 mindfulness and 22 control; age, 43-83; 30 %
women). Retention was 93 %; attendance was 94 %. Mindfulness (beta = 3.31; p =
0.04) and anxiety (beta = -1.15; p = 0.059) improved in the mindfulness group.
CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness training can be effectively phone-delivered and may
improve mindfulness and anxiety in cardiac defibrillator outpatients.

JJ, Pollack MH, Simon NM.

Hospital, One Bowdoin Sq, 6th Floor, Boston, MA 02114 ehoge@partners.org.

OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness meditation has met increasing interest as a therapeutic
strategy for anxiety disorders, but prior studies have been limited by
methodological concerns, including a lack of an active comparison group. This is 
the first randomized, controlled trial comparing the manualized Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction (MBSR) program with an active control for generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD), a disorder characterized by chronic worry and physiologic
hyperarousal symptoms.
METHOD: Ninety-three individuals with DSM-IV-diagnosed GAD were randomly assigned
to an 8-week group intervention with MBSR or to an attention control, Stress
Management Education (SME), between 2009 and 2011. Anxiety symptoms were measured
with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA; primary outcome measure), the
Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and -Improvement scales (CGI-S
and CGI-I), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Stress reactivity was assessed 
by comparing anxiety and distress during pretreatment and posttreatment
administration of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST).
RESULTS: A modified intent-to-treat analysis including participants who completed
at least 1 session of MBSR (n = 48) or SME (n = 41) showed that both
interventions led to significant (P < .0001) reductions in HAMA scores at
endpoint, but did not significantly differ. MBSR, however, was associated with a 
significantly greater reduction in anxiety as measured by the CGI-S, the CGI-I,
and the BAI (all P values < .05). MBSR was also associated with greater
reductions than SME in anxiety and distress ratings in response to the TSST
stress challenge (P < .05) and a greater increase in positive self-statements (P 
= .004).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MBSR may have a beneficial effect on
anxiety symptoms in GAD and may also improve stress reactivity and coping as
measured in a laboratory stress challenge.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested that mindfulness meditation effectively
reduced stress-related anxiety and depression symptoms, but no research has
evaluated the efficacy of mindfulness meditation in nurses and nursing students
in China.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of brief mindfulness meditation on the
anxiety and depression symptoms and autonomic nervous system activity in Chinese 
nursing students.
DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: A medical university in Guangzhou, China.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and five nursing students were randomly approached by
email and seventy-two responded. Sixty recruited students were randomized into
meditation and control group (n=30 each) after screening and exclusion due to
factors known to influence mood ratings and autonomic nervous system measures.
METHODS: The meditation group performed mindfulness meditation 30 min daily for 7
consecutive days. The control group received no intervention except pre-post
treatment measurements. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression 
Scale were administered to participants, and heart rate and blood pressure were
measured. Pre- and post-treatment data were analyzed using repeated-measures
analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Differences between pre- and post-treatment Self-Rating Anxiety Scale
scores were significantly larger in the meditation group than in the control
group, but no similar effect was observed for Self-Rating Depression Scale
scores. Systolic blood pressure was reduced more after the intervention in the
meditation group than in the control group, with an average reduction of 2.2
mmHg. A moderate level of anxiety was associated with the maximum meditation
effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Brief mindfulness meditation was beneficial for Chinese nursing
students in reducing anxiety symptoms and lowering systolic blood pressure.
Individuals with moderate anxiety are most likely to benefit from a short-term
mindfulness meditation program.

Argentine tango dance compared to mindfulness meditation and a waiting-list
control: a randomised trial for treating depression.

Pinniger R(1), Brown RF, Thorsteinsson EB, McKinley P.

Author information: 
(1)University of New England, Australia. rpinnige@une.edu.au

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether tango dancing is as effective as mindfulness
meditation in reducing symptoms of psychological stress, anxiety and depression, 
and in promoting well-being.
DESIGN: This study employed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and multiple
regression analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-seven people with self-declared depression were randomised
into tango dance or mindfulness meditation classes, or to control/waiting-list.
SETTING: classes were conducted in a venue suitable for both activities in the
metropolitan area of Sydney, Australia.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed six-week programmes (1½h/week of tango or
meditation). The outcome measures were assessed at pre-test and post-test.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; The Self Esteem
Scale; Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale.
RESULTS: Sixty-six participants completed the program and were included in the
statistical analysis. Depression levels were significantly reduced in the tango
(effect size d=0.50, p=.010), and meditation groups (effect size d=0.54, p=.025),
relative to waiting-list controls. Stress levels were significantly reduced only 
in the tango group (effect size d=0.45, p=.022). Attending tango classes was a
significant predictor for the increased levels of mindfulness R(2)=.10, adjusted 
R(2)=.07, F (2,59)=3.42, p=.039.
CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-meditation and tango dance could be effective
complementary adjuncts for the treatment of depression and/or inclusion in stress
management programmes. Subsequent trials are called to explore the therapeutic
mechanisms involved.

This study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate changes in 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) associated with the Mindfulness-based Art Therapy
(MBAT) programme and correlate such changes to stress and anxiety in women with
breast cancer. Eighteen breast cancer patients were randomized to the MBAT or
education control group. The patients received the diagnosis of breast cancer
between 6 months and 3 years prior to enrollment and were not in active
treatment. The age of participants ranged from 52 to 77 years. A voxel-based
analysis was performed to assess differences at rest, during meditation and
during a stress task. The anxiety sub-scale of the Symptoms Checklist-90-Revised 
was compared with changes in resting CBF before and after the programmes.
Subjects in the MBAT arm demonstrated significant increases in CBF at rest and
during meditation in multiple limbic regions, including the left insula, right
amygdala, right hippocampus and bilateral caudate. Patients in the MBAT programme
also had a significant correlation between increased CBF in the left caudate and 
decreased anxiety scores. In the MBAT group, responses to a stressful cue
resulted in reduced activation of the posterior cingulate. The results
demonstrate that the MBAT programme was associated with significant changes in
CBF, which correlated with decreased anxiety over an 8-week period.

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy versus psycho-education for patients with
major depression who did not achieve remission following antidepressant
treatment: a preliminary analysis.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy (MBCT) with a psycho-educational control group designed to be
structurally equivalent to the MBCT program but excluding the claimed "active
ingredient" of MBCT (i.e., mindfulness meditation practice) for the treatment of 
patients with major depression (MD).
DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled trial.
LOCATION: The study was conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, University of
Bologna, Italy.
SUBJECTS: Patients who had MD and who did not achieve remission following at
least 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment were considered for inclusion. Eligible
subjects were randomized to receive MBCT or psycho-education and were
prospectively followed for 8 weeks.
OUTCOME MEASURES: MD severity was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for
Depression (HAMD). Measures of anxiety, mindfulness, and quality of life, as
measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Mindfulness Attention and Awareness
Scale, and the Psychological General Well-being Index (PGWBI), respectively, were
also included. All assessments were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. 
Changes of psychologic variables over the study period were analyzed by means of 
the repeated-measures analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Of 29 screened subjects, 16 received MBCT or psycho-education. Both HAMD
and PGWBI scores improved to a significantly higher extent in the MBCT group than
in the psycho-educational control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by a small sample size and the lack of follow-up
measures, the results of this preliminary study suggest the superiority of MBCT
over psycho-education for subjects who had MD and who did not achieve remission
following antidepressant treatment.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is thought to reduce emotional
reactivity and enhance emotion regulation in patients with social anxiety
disorder (SAD). The goal of this study was to examine the neural correlates of
deploying attention to regulate responses to negative self-beliefs using
functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were 56 patients with
generalized SAD in a randomized controlled trial who were assigned to MBSR or a
comparison aerobic exercise (AE) stress reduction program. Compared to AE, MBSR
yielded greater (i) reductions in negative emotion when implementing regulation
and (ii) increases in attention-related parietal cortical regions. Meditation
practice was associated with decreases in negative emotion and social anxiety
symptom severity, and increases in attention-related parietal cortex neural
responses when implementing attention regulation of negative self-beliefs.
Changes in attention regulation during MBSR may be an important psychological
factor that helps to explain how mindfulness meditation training benefits
patients with anxiety disorders.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence showing beneficial effects of
mindfulness and mindfulness training on various indicators of mental and physical
health.
PURPOSE: This paper reports the 6-month follow-up effects of a mindfulness stress
reduction training program among patients treated for cancer on perceived stress,
depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, positive states of mind,
coping self-efficacy, and mindfulness.
METHODS: Patients with a previous cancer diagnosis were recruited and randomized 
into an intervention group or a waiting list control group. The intervention
consisted of an 8-week mindfulness training course.
RESULTS: Compared to participants in the control group, the intervention group
showed a larger increase in mindfulness at 6-month follow-up. However, there were
no differences on any of the other outcomes between the intervention and control 
groups. Continued meditation practice was associated with a significant reduction
in post-traumatic stress symptoms of avoidance.
CONCLUSIONS: The study draws attention to the need to better understand the
mechanisms behind the effect of mindfulness training and to potential
modification of mindfulness interventions to promote sustained benefits over
time.

CONTEXT: Patients who have received solid organ transplants continue to
experience a myriad of complex symptoms related to their underlying disease and
to chronic immunosuppression that reduce the quality of life. Beneficial
nonpharmacologic therapies to address these symptoms have not been established in
the transplant population.
OBJECTIVE: Assess the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in
reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and poor sleep in transplant patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Controlled trial with a two-staged randomization. 
Recipients of kidney, kidney/pancreas, liver, heart, or lung transplants were
randomized to MBSR (n=72) or health education (n=66) initially or after serving
in a waitlist. Mean age was 54 years (range 21-75); 55% were men, and 91% were
white.
INTERVENTIONS: MBSR, a mindfulness meditation training program consisting of
eight weekly 2.5-hour classes; health education, a peer-led active control.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), depression
(Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), and sleep quality
(Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) scales assessed by self-report at baseline, 8
weeks, 6 months, and 1 year.
RESULTS: Benefits of MBSR were above and beyond those afforded by the active
control. MBSR reduced anxiety and sleep symptoms (P < .02), with medium treatment
effects (.51 and .56) at 1 year compared to health education in
intention-to-treat analyses. Within the MBSR group, anxiety, depression, and
sleep symptoms decreased and quality-of-life measures improved by 8 weeks (P <
.01, all), and benefits were retained at 1 year (P < .05, all). Initial symptom
reductions in the health education group were smaller and not sustained.
Comparisons to the waitlist confirmed the impact of MBSR on both symptoms and
quality of life, whereas health education improvements were limited to
quality-of-life ratings.
CONCLUSIONS: MBSR reduced distressing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and poor
sleep and improved quality of life. Benefits were sustained over 1 year. A health
education program provided fewer benefits, and effects were not as durable. MBSR 
is a relatively inexpensive, safe, and effective community-based intervention.

This study evaluated the effects of Progressive Self-focus Meditation with 42
volunteers (M age = 46.0 yr., SD = 14.1) allocated to two groups: one that had
weekly 1-hr. training sessions in the practice for 5 wk. and one waiting-list
group. Participants were evaluated before and after 5 wk. on the Beck Anxiety
Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, the Digit Symbol subtest of the Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale, and the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale. After 5 
wk., a significant reduction in scores on depression was found in the Meditation 
group as well as an increase in attention in comparison with the waiting-list
Control group.

This study examined the effectiveness of a stress coping program based on
mindfulness meditation on the stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by
nursing students in Korea. A nonequivalent, control group, pre-posttest design
was used. A convenience sample of 41 nursing students were randomly assigned to
experimental (n=21) and control groups (n=20). Stress was measured with the
PWI-SF (5-point) developed by Chang. Anxiety was measured with Spieberger's state
anxiety inventory. Depression was measured with the Beck depression inventory.
The experimental group attended 90-min sessions for eight weeks. No intervention 
was administered to the control group. Nine participants were excluded from the
analysis because they did not complete the study due to personal circumstances,
resulting in 16 participants in each group for the final analysis. Results for
the two groups showed (1) a significant difference in stress scores (F=6.145,
p=0.020), (2) a significant difference in anxiety scores (F=6.985, p=0.013), and 
(3) no significant difference in depression scores (t=1.986, p=0.056). A stress
coping program based on mindfulness meditation was an effective intervention for 
nursing students to decrease their stress and anxiety, and could be used to
manage stress in student nurses. In the future, long-term studies should be
pursued to standardize and detail the program, with particular emphasis on
studies to confirm the effects of the program in patients with diseases, such as 
cancer.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been reported to reduce anxiety in 
a broad range of clinical populations. However, its efficacy in alleviating core 
symptoms of specific anxiety disorders is not well established. We conducted a
randomized trial to evaluate how well MBSR compared to a first-line psychological
intervention for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Fifty-three patients with DSM-IV 
generalized SAD were randomized to an 8-week course of MBSR or 12 weekly sessions
of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT). Although patients in both treatment
groups improved, patients receiving CBGT had significantly lower scores on
clinician- and patient-rated measures of social anxiety. Response and remission
rates were also significantly greater with CBGT. Both interventions were
comparable in improving mood, functionality and quality of life. The results
confirm that CBGT is the treatment of choice of generalized SAD and suggest that 
MBSR may have some benefit in the treatment of generalized SAD.

In contemporary western societies stress is highly prevalent, therefore the need 
for stress-reducing methods is great. This randomized controlled trial compared
the efficacy of self-help physical activity (PA), mindfulness meditation (MM),
and heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) in reducing stress and its
related symptoms. We randomly allocated 126 participants to PA, MM, or HRV-BF
upon enrollment, of whom 76 agreed to participate. The interventions consisted of
psycho-education and an introduction to the specific intervention techniques and 
5 weeks of daily exercises at home. The PA exercises consisted of a
vigorous-intensity activity of free choice. The MM exercises consisted of guided 
mindfulness meditation. The HRV-BF exercises consisted of slow breathing with a
heart rate variability biofeedback device. Participants received daily reminders 
for their exercises and were contacted weekly to monitor their progress. They
completed questionnaires prior to, directly after, and 6 weeks after the
intervention. Results indicated an overall beneficial effect consisting of
reduced stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and improved psychological
well-being and sleep quality. No significant between-intervention effect was
found, suggesting that PA, MM, and HRV-BF are equally effective in reducing
stress and its related symptoms. These self-help interventions provide easily
accessible help for people with stress complaints.

Cancer survivors experience high levels of distress, associated with a host of
negative psychological states, including anxiety, depression, and fear of
recurrence, which often lead to sleep problems and reduction in quality of life
(QOL) and well-being. As a neuropeptide hormone associated with affiliation,
calmness, and well-being, oxytocin may be a useful biological measure of changes 
in health outcomes in cancer survivors. In this exploratory study, which
comprised a subset of participants from a larger study, we evaluated (a) the
feasibility and reliability of salivary oxytocin (sOT) levels in cancer survivors
and (b) the effects of 2 sleep-focused mind-body interventions, mind-body
bridging (MBB) and mindfulness meditation (MM), compared with a sleep hygiene
education (SHE) control, on changes in sOT levels in 30 cancer survivors with
self-reported sleep disturbance. Interventions were conducted in 3 sessions, once
per week for 3 weeks. Saliva samples were collected at baseline, postintervention
(~1 week after the last session), and at the 2-month follow-up. In this cancer
survivor group, we found that intra-individual sOT levels were fairly stable
across the 3 time points, of about 3 months' duration, and mean baseline sOT
levels did not differ between females and males and were not correlated with age.
Correlations between baseline sOT and self-report measures were weak; however,
several of these relationships were in the predicted direction, in which sOT
levels were negatively associated with sleep problems and depression and
positively associated with cancer-related QOL and well-being. Regarding
intervention effects on sOT, baseline-subtracted sOT levels were significantly
larger at postintervention in the MBB group as compared with those in SHE. In
this sample of cancer survivors assessed for sOT, at postintervention, greater
reductions in sleep problems were noted for MBB and MM compared with that of SHE,
and increases in mindfulness and self-compassion were observed in the MBB group
compared with those in SHE. The findings in this exploratory study suggest that
sOT may be a reliable biological measure over time that may provide insight into 
the effects of mind-body interventions on health outcomes in cancer survivors.
